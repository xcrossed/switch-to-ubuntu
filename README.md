# switch to Ubuntu

As a programmer, do you still use windows for development? Have you used windows for many years?
It's time to switch to Ubuntu.
If you are not a programmer, you already hate the various pop-up windows under windows, and you do nâ€™t want to use mac, then Ubuntu will be your best choice.

You need to download a ubuntu system image to a U disk, make a boot disk or your computer motherboard supports UEFI, you can directly copy the files to the u disk and start the installation directly. The download address is https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop.
